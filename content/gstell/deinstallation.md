# Gstell - Deinstallation

### Browser Extension
On Firefox, go to [about:addons](about:addons) and on Chrome/Edge, go to [chrome:extensions](chrome:extensions). Remove the extension from your browser.

### Native application
1. Remove/deinstall the application.
2. On Windows, make sure to delete `/AppData/Roaming/Gstell` to clean up data collected during the study.
3. On macOS, make sure to delete `/Users/<your user>/Library/Application Support/Gstell` to clean up data collected during the study. 
   1. Notice that `Library` is a [hidden folder](https://www.techradar.com/how-to/how-to-show-hidden-files-in-macos) which is not visible by default in your Finder.
   2. For a more thorough clean up, consider using a dedicated application (such as [AppCleaner](http://freemacsoft.net/appcleaner/)).
